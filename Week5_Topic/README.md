### Task2: attacks on CPU execution
spectre and meltdown are two original side channel attacks discovered in 2017 that target cpu, and over the years more have been discovered. [This wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_execution_CPU_vulnerability) list some of them. Pick 3 of them to research about how exactly each exploits the system,their differences, which systems they targeted and how they can be mitigated. 

Answer in max 300 words. You are free to use tables or otherwise make to comparison easier to read if you wish.

### Task3: Securing OS
Following is a list of some of the more common vulnerabilities and attack vectors existing in operating systems.  

- Malware and Viruses
- Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities
- Phishing and Social Engineering
- Drive-by Downloads
- Zero-Day Exploits
- USB/Removable Media Attacks
- Password Cracking

Make short write up about each that answers following questions 
1. What harm can it cause to you?
2. How OS of your choosing (Windows, Mac, Linux) can mitigate it?
     - Function of the OS itself or external tools?

### Task4: Logging
Log files are records of events or actions that occur in a system, application, or program. Logs are essential for troubleshooting, debugging, and analyzing the behavior of software or hardware.

Find answers to following questions:
1.What kind of information would be saved into following types of log files
- Application logs
- Event logs
- Service logs
- System logs

2.Where in each of the common Operating Systems those logs would be stored (Windows, Mac, Linux(changes per distro so provide in answer wich you are using)
3.What kind of threads you could you notice by monitoring each log file?
4.How would you go about monitoring logs on your personal computer?


remember to list sources for information you use!
