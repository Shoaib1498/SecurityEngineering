# Tasks

### Task 1: Lock-ins

Situations where a client or business grows relies on a supplier or on a specific part of technology, making it expensive to move to alternative solutions, are referred to as lock-ins. Technological lock-ins occur when a company only uses a single technology, which raises the cost of switching because of infrastructure or talent requirements. Vendor lock-ins, on the other hand, happen when a business is dependent on a certain vendor’s good or service, making switching to a competitor difficult or costly. 
Retraining employees, buying new technologies, or taking a chance on operational downtime are just a few of the significant expenses involved in breaking free from these lock-ins. Still, staying in a lock-in might have drawbacks such as reduced flexibility, higher costs, and stifled innovation. 
For instance, I once dealt with cloud service provider vendor lock-in, where switching to a different provider was challenging due to the proprietary technology. We had to choose between sticking with that vendor or bearing the hefty switching expenses.

### Task2: Security Psychology


- why are phishing attacks effective enough to be widespread practice?
  Phishing attacks take advantage of people’s cognitive weaknesses, such as trust and haste. Attackers use spam emails or communications to imitate reliable sources while appealing to feelings like excitement or terror. Because this avoids logical decision-making, recipients are more inclined to divulge sensitive information or click on harmful sites.
- why social engineering works on people?
  Utilizing social psychology concepts such as authority, trust, and reciprocity, social engineering operates. The main causes are sensitivity, overconfidence, and human error. Attackers most of the time assume the identity of reputable individuals such as CEOs or tech support. In this way the hackers trick victims into revealing private information or permitting access to networks.
- why many people have hard time using  passwords in secure way?
   According to behavioral psychology, security concerns are often subordinated to convenience. Many people turn to weak or reusing passwords because they find it difficult to keep track of several complex, long and complicated passwords. A significant contributing cause to poor password management is the challenge of striking a balance between security best practices and convenience of use.
- why PGP fails to be effective way to secure email?
Although PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption is technically secure, usability problems cause it to fail. Because of the user interface’s complexity and need for technical expertise, cognitive overload occurs. Because non-expert users find it too difficult to manage encryption keys and complete necessary operations, this leads to a low adoption rate.
- why it is so easy to spread malware?
Because hackers take advantage of software flaws and human behavior, malware spreads quickly. Techniques such as drive-by downloads, phony updates, and malicious attachments take advantage of consumers’ ignorance, curiosity, and trust. Furthermore, malware developers are always evolving to avoid being discovered by conventional protection method.

## Task 3:

### Task3A: Intellectual Rights
 

- intellectual property (IP)
IP is the term used to describe mentally generated works of art that are legally protected, such as inventions, literary works, or designs. To protect these assets, businesses apply for patents.

  Copyright gives the owner of an original work the only authority to use, share, and alter their creations. It is frequently used in reference to creative, literary, or musical works. 
 

- patent
  A patent gives the owner of a new and useful invention the only authority to make, use, and sell the invention without the owner’s consent.
- trademark
  A legally registered trademark is a sign, name, or phrase that is used to identify a product or company and guarantee unique brand identification. 
- Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)
  NDAs are formal contracts that restricts people or businesses from disclosing confidential information without authorization.

along with employing technologies such as:

- watermarks
- software licenses
- digital rights management (DRM)
- software protection dongles
